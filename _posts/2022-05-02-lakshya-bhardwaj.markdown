## Title

Non-Invertible Higher-Categorical Symmetries.

## Abstract 

I will describe construction of non-invertible symmetries described by higher-categories by performing gauging of invertible higher-form symmetries. Some simple examples carrying such symmetries are provided by gauge field theories with disconnected gauge groups.
