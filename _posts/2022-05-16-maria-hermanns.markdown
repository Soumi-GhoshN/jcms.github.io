# May 16th, 2022: Maria Hermanns

On Monday, May 16th, 2022 from 11 am to 12 am we hosted a seminar by **Maria Hermanns** from **Stockholm University**.

## Title

Fate of Boundary Modes

## Abstract 

One general hallmark of topological phases of matter is the existence of robust zero-energy boundary modes. The stability of the modes is ensured by so-called topological invariants, which in turn rely on the existence of an energy gap. In this talk, we discuss how much of this survives when the system becomes critical. In particular, we discuss how one may generalize topological invariants to systems without an energy gap, as well as the fate of boundary modes.
