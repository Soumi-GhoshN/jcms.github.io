# December 12th, 2022: Apoorv Tiwari

On Monday, December 12th, 2022 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Apoorv Tiwari** from **KTH, Royal Institute of Technology**. 

## Title

Unifying Constructions of Non-Invertible Symmetries

## Abstract 

The realization that global symmetry can be understood as the topological subsector of the spectrum of operators of a given QFT/ quantum system has led to new global symmetries that vastly generalize conventional group-like symmetries. In particular, various constructions of non-invertible (not group-like) symmetries have appeared in the literature in the last couple of years. All of these non-invertible symmetries are built from invertible symmetries and dualities (suitably interpreted). This makes one wonder whether all these constructions are actually different manifestations of an underlying uniform construction of non-invertible symmetries starting from invertible objects.  In this talk, I will present such a unified construction. The construction is based on new insights related to gauging global symmetries in quantum systems. Along the way, I will provide some examples based on Ising-type lattice models as well as pure gauge theories.
