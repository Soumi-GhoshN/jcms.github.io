# February 6th, 2023: Jonas Larson

On Monday, February 6th, 2023 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Jonas Larson** from **Stockholm University**. 

## Title

Fluctuations and non-hermitian quantum mechanics

## Abstract 

Non-hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM) has developed into an active research field. Here, losses are taken into account by allowing for non-hermitian Hamiltonians. As a result, a plethora of novel phenomena arrises, like exceptional points and the skin effect. In non-linear classical optics we have seen how such Hamiltonians can qualitatively describe the physics. I claim that in quantum systems the interpretations become more problematic. Apart from interpretations, NHQM also break many well established concepts, like the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and contextuality. Trying to shed light on these issues I analyze the Hatano-Nelson model, both with and without fluctuations, and demonstrate qualitative different results.
