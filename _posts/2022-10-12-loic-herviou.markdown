# October 24th, 2022: Loïc Herviou

On Monday, October 24th, 2022 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Loïc Herviou** from **EPFL, Lausanne**. 

## Title

Possible restoration of particle-hole symmetry in the 5/2 Quantized Hall State at small magnetic field

## Abstract 

Motivated by the experimental observation of a quantized 5/2 thermal conductance at filling 5/2, a result incompatible with the theoretical predictions, we have pushed the expansion of the effective Hamiltonian of the 5/2 quantized Hall state to third-order in the Landau level mixing parameter.

After a brief introduction on the FQHE and the physics of the 5/2 state, I will show that our exact diagonalization computations suggest that the energy differences between Pfaffian and AntiPfaffian states are significantly smaller than expected, and that the particle-hole symmetry might be restored in the experimental regime.
