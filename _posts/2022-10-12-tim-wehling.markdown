# January 23rd, 2023: Tim Wehling

On Monday, January 23rd, 2023 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Tim Wehling** from **University of Hamburg**. 

## Title

Coherence and pairing fluctuations in strongly correlated superconductors

## Abstract 

The fundamental properties of superfluids and superconductors are determined by the spatial coherence of the macroscopic condensate. Central to this characterization is the knowledge of the coherence length ùúâ, as it specifies the relevant length scales for fluctuations pertinent to, e.g., the formation of vortex latices or magneto-thermal transport. While the description of ùúâ is well established in weak-coupling BCS theory and Eliashberg-theory, it is a generally unknown quantity in strongly correlated superconductors, where spatiotemporal fluctuations influence the critical temperature [1] and might underlie light-induced enhancement of superconductivity [2].

We discuss how to access coherence lengths for superconductors with strong electron correlations from microscopic theories and first principles. We illustrate with the example of Alkali-doped fullerides (A3C60) how proximity of superconducting and Mott-localized states impact superconducting coherence, pairing fluctuations, and critical temperature. Our analysis shows Eliashberg-type behavior of strongly correlated superconductors.
