# February 26th, 2024: Nicolas Bauer

On Monday, February 26th, 2024 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Nicolas Bauer** from **WÃ¼rzburg University**. 

## Title

A quench-probe setup for analyzing fractional entanglement spreading

## Abstract 

We propose a novel spatially inhomogeneous setup for revealing quench-induced fractionalized excitations in entanglement dynamics. In this quench-probe setting, the region undergoing a quantum quench is tunnel-coupled to a static region, the probe. Subsequently, the timedependent entanglement signatures of a tunable subset of excitations propagating to the probe are monitored. We exemplify the power of this generic approach by identifying a unique dynamical signature associated with the presence of an isolated Majorana zero mode in the post-quench Hamiltonian. In this case excitations emitted from the topological part of the system give rise to a fractionalized jump of log(2)/2 in the entanglement entropy of the probe. This dynamical effect is highly sensitive to the localized nature of the Majorana zero mode, but does not require the preparation of a topological initial state.
