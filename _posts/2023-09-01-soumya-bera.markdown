# September 11th, 2023: Soumya Bera

On Monday, September 11th, 2023 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Soumya Bera** from **Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**. 

## Title

Internal clock for many-body delocalization

## Abstract 


There is a growing consensus that generic disordered quantum
 wires, e.g. the XXZ-Heisenberg chain, do not exhibit many-body
 localization (MBL) - at least not in a strict sense within a
 reasonable window of disorder values. Specifically, computational
 studies of short wires exhibit an extremely slow but unmistakable flow
 of physical observables with increasing time and system size (`creep')
 that is consistently directed away from (strict) localization. Our
 work sheds fresh light on delocalization physics: Strong
 sample-to-sample fluctuations indicate the absence of a generic time
 scale, i.e., of a naive "clock rate"; however, the concept of an
 "internal clock" survives, at least in an ensemble sense.
 Specifically, we investigate the relaxation of the charge imbalance
 and the entanglement entropy in a 1D system of interacting disordered
 fermions. We observe that the average entropy appropriately models the
 ensemble-averaged internal clock and reduces fluctuations. We take the
 tendency for faster-than-logarithmic growth of entanglement and smooth
 dependency on the disorder of all our observables within the entire
 simulation window as support for the cross-over scenario, discouraging
 an MBL transition within the traditional parametric window of
 computational studies.
