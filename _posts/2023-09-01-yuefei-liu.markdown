## Title

Quantum analog of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation

## Abstract 

The series of Landau-Lifshitz equations, e.g. Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, reveals the mechanism of angular momentum dynamics between atomic spin and dissipation of energy [1]. It plays an essential role for describing the dynamics of magnetization, or spin dynamics, in solid classically, which has navigated the spintronic applications into a new era [2]. While a quantum analog of the Landau-Lifshitz dynamics has been proposed in Ref.[3],  the corresponding quantum version of LLG remains unknown. In this talk, we focus on a new proposed quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (qLLG) equation [4]. First, we try to answer few fundamental questions regarding the qLLG type of quantum dynamics, such as the state purity conservation and comparison with classical counterpart of spin systems. Then, we present the qLLG dynamics of quantum correlations, i.e., entanglement and nonlocality, in two-qubit (dimer) systems as demonstrated try out.
