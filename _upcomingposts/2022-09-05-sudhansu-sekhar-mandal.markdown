## Title

Anomalous Re-entrant Quantized 5/2 Fractional Quantum Hall State

## Abstract 

Although most of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states in the lowest Landau level are well understood in terms of the composite fermion theory, the FQHE states in the second Landau level remain illusive. Amongst these, 5/2 state is the most intriguing as it is the cooperative system where the existence of Majorana edge mode was first proposed. Thermal Hall conductance and shot-noise experiments are in favour of the existence of such modes. However, the experimentally reported topological order (on which the above quantities depend) is reported to be different from the theoretically predicted topological order for small or no Landau-level-mixing (LLM) which induces three-body interaction. Our exact-diagonalization study reveals [1] a topological phase transition from conventional low LLM phase to an anomalous re-entrant quantized phase at moderate LLM strength. We attribute this novel phase to the experimentally observed topological order. Our predicted ground-state wave function which is found to have very high overlap with the exact ground state in this phase is a simple representative wave function for understanding this topological order.
