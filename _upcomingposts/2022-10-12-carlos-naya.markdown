# May 8th, 2023: Carlos Naya

On Monday, May 8th, 2023 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Carlos Naya** from **Jagiellonian University**. 

## Title

Versatile 3D solitons: from the Skyrme model to frustrated magnets

## Abstract 

In the last years, the study of topological solitons and related structures in condensed matter systems has attracted much attention. Different configurations such as planar Skyrmions or Hopfions have been studied in detail, but 3D Skyrmions, resembling those from the Skyrme model of nuclei, have remained elusive. In this talk, I will present a modification of the Skyrme model which interpolates between Hopfions and usual 3D Skyrmions. Then, I will focus on how this model can be realised in frustrated magnets, showing they can host these configurations. I will pay attention to solitons arising for different values of the topological charge and their similarities to those from the Skyrme model of nuclei.
