# January 12th, 2022: Felix von Oppen

On **Thursday, January 12th, 2022 from 13 to 14** we will host a seminar by **Felix von Oppen** from **Freie Universit√§t Berlin**. 

Note the unsual date and time for this seminar.

## Title

Diode effects in current-biased Josephson junctions

## Abstract 

Current flow in electronic devices can be asymmetric with bias direction, a phenomenon underlying the utility of diodes and known as non-reciprocal charge transport. The promise of dissipationless electronics has recently stimulated the quest for superconducting diodes. Non-reciprocal Josephson junctions are particularly promising for device applications, for instance in the context of superconducting qubits. In this talk, I will discuss a recent experiment, in which non-reciprocity is observed as the result of introducing a single magnetic atom into the Josephson junction and use this as a starting point for developing a general theory of non-reciprocal transport in current-biased Josephson junctions. This will include a discussion of the symmetry requirements underlying non-reciprocal transport. I will also briefly describe a generalized derivation of the Keldysh action of Josephson junctions, which incorporates non-reciprocity.
