# June 5th, 2023: Marcus Stålhammar

On Monday, June 5th, 2023 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Marcus Stålhammar** from **Nordita**. 

## Title

Fractal nodal band structures and Fermi surfaces

## Abstract 

The studies of fractal lines and surfaces comprise a promising venue within complex dynamics and topology, with profound applications in various venues in physics. Here, condensed matter physics comprise one example, where factuality marks a transition between the ergodic and localized phase. On the other hand, recent years have marked a paradigm shift within physics research as non-effective Hamiltonians have gained vastly increased attention. This has lead to the discovery of numerous novel and uniquely non-Hermitian topological phenomena, many of which are related to the ubiquitous appearance of exceptional points where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leaving the parent Hamiltonian defective.

In this talk, I merge these two concepts by illustrating the appearance of fractal lines of exceptional points and fractal Fermi surfaces in 2D non-Hermitian systems subject to parity-time symmetry. I also show how the notion of factuality can be generalized to 3D by considering various setups, both in the Hermitian and the non-Hermitian realms, and how the presence/absence of parity-time symmetry affects the systems. These results are of experimental relevance within a wide range of different areas of physics, which I will briefly discuss, and might thus have interesting applications on the physics of Fermi surface instability driven phenomena, such as superconductivity and charge-density waves, but also in the context of analogue gravity and black hole physics.
