# November 7th, 2022: Thomas Kvorning

On Monday, November 7th, 2022 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Thomas Kvorning** from **KTH**. 

## Title

What question does Bell's theorem address?

## Abstract 

Bell's theorem is often cited as one of the most important results in quantum foundations. Still, there is a disagreement about what the theorem addresses. John Bell argued that the theorem concerns causality, while hidden variables are a tool in the derivation. Nevertheless, the first sentence of John Bell's Wikipedia page states that Bell's theorem concerns hidden variable theories.

I will dedicate my presentation to the notion of local causality. Even though this seemingly is a familiar concept, failure to understand it is widespread and at the root of the mentioned disagreement.
