# June 5th, 2024: Ahmed Abouelkomsan

On Wednesday, June 5th, 2024 from 3 pm to 4 pm we will host a seminar by **Ahmed Abouelkomsan** from **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**. 

## Title

The Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and Beyond

## Abstract 

Groundbreaking experiments [1-5] on twisted MoTe2 and pentalayer rhombohedral graphene have observed for the first time the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect which is the fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field. I will review the current experimental and theoretical efforts to understand and characterize these phases. In addition to the incompressible abelian FQAH observed, experiments also observed signatures of a compressible state which is likely to be the anomalous analogue of the composite Fermi liquid (CFL). I will argue that the anomalous composite Fermi liquid is fundamentally different from the normal Fermi liquid and characterized by a vanishing Drude weight [7]. I will conclude the talk by discussing a recent intriguing experiment observing the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted MoTe2 [8] and various predictions for possible non-abelian topological order [9].
