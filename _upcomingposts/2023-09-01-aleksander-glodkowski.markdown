## Title

Hydrodynamic theory of fracton fluids


## Abstract 

The long-wavelength dynamics of generic many-body systems, such as fluids and gases, are described by the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations. In this talk, I will present the hydrodynamic theory for fracton fluids, which are many-body systems with microscopically constrained dynamics. Specifically, I will focus on homogeneous and isotropic systems that, in addition to a conserved U(1) monopole charge, also respect the conservation of the associated dipole moment. I will explore the implications of these constraints on macroscopic transport properties and describe two distinct low-energy phases arising from different symmetry-breaking patterns. Finally, I will discuss some potential applications to condensed matter systems.
