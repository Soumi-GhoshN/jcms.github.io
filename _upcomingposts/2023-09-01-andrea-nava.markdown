# May 30th, 2024: Andrea Nava

On Thursday, May 30th, 2024 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Andrea Nava** from **Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf**. 

## Title

Dissipation driven dynamical topological phase transitions in two-dimensional superconductors

## Abstract 

We induce and study a topological dynamical phase transition between two planar superconducting phases. Using the Lindblad equation to account for the interactions of Bogoliubov quasiparticles among themselves and with the fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, we derive the relaxation dynamics of the order parameter. To characterize the phase transition, we compute the fidelity and the spin-Hall conductance of the open system. Our approach provides crucial information for experimental implementations, such as the dependence of the critical time on the system-bath coupling.
