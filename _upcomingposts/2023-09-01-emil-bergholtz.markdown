# November 27th, 2023: Emil J. Bergholtz

On Monday, November 27th, 2023 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Emil J. Bergholtz** from **Stockholm University**. 

## Title

Moiré Anyons

## Abstract 

Remarkable recent experiments have realized fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states without the need for magnetic fields in engineered moiré superlattice materials. I will give a brief introduction to this topic and argue that it is beautiful, challenging, and rich in future prospects.
