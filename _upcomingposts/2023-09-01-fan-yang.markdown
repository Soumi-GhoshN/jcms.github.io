# October 28th, 2024: Fan Yang

On Monday, October 28th, 2024 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Fan Yang** from **Stockholm University**. 

## Title

Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes


## Abstract 

The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention [1]. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, d, with open boundaries in dc â‰¤ d directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory [2] accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches [3] accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.
