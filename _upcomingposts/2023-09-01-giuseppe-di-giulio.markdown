# November 18th, 2024: Giuseppe Di Giulio

On Monday, November 18th, 2024 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Guiseppe Di Giulios** from **Stockholm University**.

## Abstract 
Entanglement is a fundamental treat of quantum mechanics, and nowadays, its study is at the core of many fields of physics, ranging from condensed matter theory to high-energy physics. Recently, the question of how entanglement properties encode information on the symmetries of a system has been intensively investigated. The main tools for this purpose are the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement splits into different charge sectors.
In this talk, I will discuss the main features of the symmetry-resolved entanglement in one-dimensional models, focusing in particular on the entanglement equipartition. This is the fact that, at the leading order in the subsystem size, the entanglement is the same in all the charge sectors. I will show how this result can be obtained in critical systems described by conformal field theories and how the presence of a mass gap and other microscopic scales influence this finding. Similar concepts and techniques can be used to quantify the symmetry breaking at the level of the subsystem and detect its dynamical restoration. For this goal, I will briefly mention the entanglement asymmetry and its possible future applications.
