# February 12th, 2024: Per Moosavi

On Monday, February 12th, 2024 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Per Moosavi** from **Stockholm University**. 

## Title

Anisotropic quantum Hall droplets

## Abstract 

I will discuss recent work on 2D droplets of non-interacting electrons in strong magnetic fields, confined by an anisotropic trapping potential. Using semiclassical methods, we obtain the one-particle energy spectrum and wave functions in the lowest Landau level by deriving and solving a transport equation inspired by standard WKB theory. This shows that energy eigenstates are localized on equipotentials of the trap, generalizing the rotational-symmetric situation for isotropic traps. From these microscopic first-principle considerations, we obtain explicit results for many-body observables for anisotropic quantum Hall droplets in the thermodynamic limit, including its microwave absorption spectrum which we demonstrate should allow to experimentally probe the anisotropy. In particular, we show that correlations along the droplet's edge are long-ranged, in agreement with low-energy edge modes described by a free chiral conformal field theory in terms of the canonical angle variable of the trapping potential.
